Whilst phishing emails can seem very professional, there are usually a number ofclues to alert you to the fraudulent nature of the emails. When reading an email claiming to be sent from Faforlife, you should always keep the following questionsin mind: • Are you being asked to provide your password? Faforlife will never ask you to provide your password in response to an email or phone call. • Are you being threatened with losing access to your account?
